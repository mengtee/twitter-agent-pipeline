      "text": "🚨 Altcoins to Watch | First Week of Feb 2026\n\n🔹 $ZIL — Cancun mainnet upgrade via hard fork this week. A bounce from $0.0039 could spark upside, but losing $0.0036 invalidates the bullish setup.\n\n🔥 $HYPE — Up 34% in 7 days, trading near $30. Decoupling from BTC (-0.49 correlation) supports strength. Break $30.84 → $34.31 in play. Lose $26.82 = risk to $23.69.\n\n🚀 $CC — One of the strongest performers, +30% weekly. Just hit its 3rd ATH at $0.195. Inflows remain strong; $0.215 is next if momentum holds.\n\n👀 ATH Watch: $RAIN, $KITE, $STABLE\n⚠️ High Liquidation Risk: $SOL, $HYPE, $TRX\n🐸 Meme Coin Momentum: $BUTTCOIN, $WHITEWHALE, $EGL1\n\n⚡ Volatility + unlocks + liquidations = stay sharp this week.\n\n#Crypto #Altcoins #CryptoTrading #DeFi #Bitcoin #Ethereum #Memecoins #CryptoNews #Web3 #BullMarket",
