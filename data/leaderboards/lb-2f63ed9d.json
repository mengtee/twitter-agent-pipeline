It’s the bootstrapping the markets; deep events coverage, resolutions, liquidity!\n\nThat’s the core moat Polymarket has. They have markets on nearly every event happening in the world. That’s why Jupiter or Coinbase is integrating instead of building theirs.",

Rumors suggest a return to the 2015 model: exporting enriched uranium to Russia\n(Note: Iran's MFA currently dismisses this as \"speculation\")\n\n- Facing internal pressure, the AEOI head claimed Iran is opening a \"new chapter of achievements\" - widely seen as Tehran building leverage before the talks\n\n- The NYT, citing sources, reports that under unprecedented US pressure and the threat of direct escalation, Iran has expressed readiness to fully suspend or even shut down its nuclear program\n\n- President Pezeshkian confirmed on X: the groundwork for negotiations is ready, and the MFA has its instructions\n\n- This Friday in Istanbul, Special Envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are set to meet with Iranian FM Araghchi\n\nNews is moving at light speed! \n\nI'm using @ratio_dot_you to cut through the noise, react instantly, and front-run the market shifts!\n\nAccess the terminal:\n\n---",

The new structure is valued at $1.25 trillion. This is the cornerstone of the future X Holdings\n\n＞On January 21, K2 Merger Sub Inc. entities were registered in Nevada - a classic vehicle for rapid acquisitions. The filings list SpaceX CFO Bret Johnsen\n\n＞Musk announced an \"honorable discharge\" for the Model S and Model X! The Fremont factory is being retooled for Optimus robots, effectively removing the final technological barrier between the \"space\" and \"automotive\" branches of the empire\n\nMain risk for \"YES\" - timing!\n\nTesla is a public giant. Navigating a valuation for the private SpaceX, passing audits, and dodging shareholder lawsuits by June 30 is an \"Herculean\" task\n\nWatch Nevada: any movement of Tesla assets into this jurisdiction will be the signal\n\nI'm using @ratio_dot_you to front-run these moves!\n\nYou get the news headline and the market interface in a single view - letting you hit the trade before the odds shift\n\nAccess the beta:",

This owner just trades a certain amount of volume and profit on each account.\n\nIdk why he's doing this. But he could use his trading volume in @Chance_ incentive system.\n\nIn their rewards program, for every $500 traded through their terminal, you receive a code (max up to 10 codes) that gives access to the beta test.\n\nYou can share these codes with other traders. And they will be assigned to you. \n\nThere is no official information yet about what rewards you will receive for ppl signing up using your ref code. But, anyway, you'll show your activity even at the beta testing stage.\n\nEven now, the project is already in 2nd place on @PolymarketBuild. Imagine the benefits you may have later as an early active user.\n\nBtw, I also saw many tweets on X about an upcoming update of this terminal.\n\nSmth big is coming.\n\n---",
